✅ INSTALLATION COMPLETE - FULL SUCCESS!
================================================

📊 Final Status
================================================

CONDA ENVIRONMENT (wifi3d):
  ✅ Miniforge installed to: ~/miniforge3
  ✅ Environment created: wifi3d
  ✅ Python 3.11 active
  ✅ Open3D 0.19.0+54b04af → VISUALIZATION WORKS!
  ✅ OpenCV 4.13.0
  ✅ NumPy 2.4.2
  ✅ All core packages installed

PIP VENV (.venv):
  ✅ Still available for pip-based work
  ⚠️  Does not have open3d (keep conda for visualization)

THIRD-PARTY REPOS:
  ✅ Person-in-WiFi-3D-repo
  ✅ NeRF2
  ✅ 3D_wifi_scanner

VIEWER MODULES:
  ✅ realtime_viewer.py imports and works
  ✅ hyper_view.py imports and works


🚀 How to Use
================================================

To activate the conda environment with FULL visualization:

    source ~/.bashrc
    conda activate wifi3d

Then run any project script:

    python run_realtime_hop.py              # ✅ 3D visualization works!
    python run_skeleton_demo.py             # ✅ Works!
    python run_js_visualizer.py             # ✅ Works!
    python tools/train_reid_v2.py           # ✅ Works!


📝 Command Quick Reference
================================================

Activate conda environment:
    conda activate wifi3d

Check what's installed:
    conda list

Run scripts:
    python your_script.py

Exit conda environment:
    conda deactivate

Switch to pip venv (if needed):
    source .venv/bin/activate


🔄 Switching Between Environments
================================================

CONDA (wifi3d) - For visualization:
    source ~/.bashrc
    conda activate wifi3d

PIP (.venv) - For data processing without visualization:
    source .venv/bin/activate

They don't interfere - just activate one at a time.


📋 What's Different
================================================

The Conda Environment (wifi3d):
  - Has open3d from conda-forge (ARM64 optimized)
  - Visualizations work perfectly
  - Better for CPU-intensive work
  - Python 3.11

The Pip Venv (.venv):
  - No open3d (not on PyPI for ARM64)
  - Good for data processing
  - Python 3.13
  - Still available for reference


✨ Features Now Available
================================================

✅ 3D Real-time Visualization (Open3D)
✅ WiFi CSI Processing
✅ Data Analysis & ML
✅ Jupyter Notebooks
✅ Full Feature Set

All visualization functions now work:
  - src/pipeline/realtime_viewer.py
  - src/pipeline/hyper_view.py
  - Any other Open3D-dependent code


📚 Documentation
================================================

- START_HERE.md             - Quick reference
- INSTALLATION_COMPLETE.md  - Full details
- INSTALL_STATUS.md         - Status & troubleshooting
- RPI_SETUP.md              - Raspberry Pi specific
- environment-arm64.yml     - Conda spec used
- verify_installation.sh    - Check what's installed


🎉 You're All Set!
================================================

Your wifi-3d-fusion installation is now COMPLETE with:
  ✅ All core dependencies
  ✅ 3D visualization support
  ✅ Third-party repositories
  ✅ Both conda and pip environments

Next steps:
  1. Run: source ~/.bashrc && conda activate wifi3d
  2. Try: python run_realtime_hop.py
  3. Enjoy visualization! 🎨
